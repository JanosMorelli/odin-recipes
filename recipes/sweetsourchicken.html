    <h2>Everyone’s favorite Sweet and Sour Chicken!</h2>
    <p>Juicy tender chicken coated in a tangy and savory sauce, Sweet and Sour Chicken hit the spot every single time. Sweet and Sour Chicken pairs well with everything; you can serve it with my Classic Egg Fried Rice, Taiwanese Chow Mein, or my better than takeout 20 minutes Chow Mein noodles. </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 pieces of boneless chicken thigh (cut into bite-sized pieces)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup of Rice Flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup of Corn Starch</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of Soy Sauce </li>
        <li>1 tbsp of Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to season</li>
        <li>⅓ cup of Soda Water </li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>3 Pepper of your choice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of minced garlic </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sweet and Sour Sauce </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Tbsp of Ketchup</li>
        <li>2.5 Tbsp of Rice Vinegar</li>
        <li>1.5 Tbsp of Plum Sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of  Soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of Oyster Sauce </li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Sugar (optional) </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, minced garlic, salt, pepper, corn starch, rice flour, soda water, and egg.</li><br>
        <li>Massage everything together; you want a thick but slightly runny consistency; add more rice flour or soda water if needed. Rest for 20 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Mix soy sauce, oyster sauce, ketchup, rice vinegar, plum sauce, and sugar.</li><br>
        <li>Add in oil (enough to cover the chicken) in a pan, and turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil is hot, add in the chicken and deep fry for 6-7 minutes or until golden brown.</li><br>
        <li>Optional: remove the chicken, set it aside. Turn the heat up to high, add back in the chicken, and deep fry for 1-2 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>In a separate pan, add in oil and turn the heat to medium-high—next, add in minced garlic and chopped bell pepper of your choice. Saute together for 1-2 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Drizzle in the sauce and let it simmer for 1-2 minutes or until it becomes a thicker consistency.</li><br>
        <li>Add in crispy chicken and saute on high heat for 1 minute. </li>
    </ol>
