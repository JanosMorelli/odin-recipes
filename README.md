In this project, I will demonstrate my understanding of HTML 
elements, absolute and relative links, ordered and unordered 
lists as I build a basic recipe website. The website will consist 
of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I followed every step in the assignment and after finishing the project, I went to GitHub to review and publish it. To my surprise, I realized that I hadn't committed anything along the way. I recognized this as a classic beginner mistake. However, I reminded myself that since I'm new to this, I haven't yet developed the habit of working simultaneously with a version control system as the same time as a code and follow instructions.

I removed all the code and added it back step by step before pushing it to Github. I thought this was the easiest method since all my code was completed and functional. However, when I tried to publish the website on Github, one out of three links didn't work, resulting in a "page not found" and a 404 error message.

I pondered what could have caused this issue and tried various solutions.

Ultimately, I decided to delete the repository and start over, as my initial coding wasn't done correctly using git.

Since I was only working with HTML and not modifying it with CSS or JavaScript, or dividing it into different sections with a 'div', I decided to push each page when it was fully structured with all the elements, including pictures.

Once finished, I published the new repository and voila, everything worked.

I quickly learned that simply copying and pasting while using Git fails to grasp the true reason why we use Git in the first place. I feel that I rapidly learned the most common commands for working with git due to my frequent commits while trying to solve the issue. 

I also struggled with determining the appropriate naming conventions for pictures and HTML files. I also mixed Swedish recipes with English, so through this process, I also learned the importance of planning and establishing naming conventions early on.
